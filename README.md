# Count-Count-CLI

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share my very first CLI game project with you - Count-Count-CLI! I'm just getting started on my coding journey with GitHub, and this project is a small step in my learning process.

## About the Project

Count-Count-CLI is a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) game that I built as a hobby project. It's designed to help you practice counting while having some fun. Here's what you can expect:

- **Counting Challenges:** The game currently offers 10 levels of counting challenges, divided into two units.
- **Unit 1:** Count various random shapes like arrows, pyramids, squares, and more.
- **Unit 2:** Challenge yourself to count random letters A-Z and numbers 0-9.

I'm constantly working on improving and expanding this game, so stay tuned for more levels and features!
