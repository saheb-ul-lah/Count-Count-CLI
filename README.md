# Count-Count-CLI
My first beginner-friendly CLI game! It offers 10 levels of counting challenges. Count shapes like arrows, pyramids, and more in Unit 1, and letters A-Z and numbers 0-9 in Unit 2. More levels are on the way. Your feedback is highly appreciated as I continue to develop and expand this game. Give it a go and enjoy some counting fun!
